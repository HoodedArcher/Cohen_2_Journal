    First we search for headers. We search for the header by using the command xxd.
    Then we grep to find the line.
    Using the value from that - we use echo and bc to convert hexidecimal to a decimal number.
    For example, in the example from yesterday, we found the base and converted it to decimal using the command xxd.
    Then to find the end of the file, we searched for ffd9 using the command xxd and piping to grep.
    ******************************************************
    Using that information, we find the number of bits, using the command echo and pipe bc by subtracting the start and end of the line.
    Then using dd we can reconstruct the file using the command dd if=image_carve.raw of=carve.jpg skip=21156 bs=1 count=6610
