I learned how cool of a place Rackspace is. Rackspace is looking for people very
about technology and learning. At Rackspace most people that work there are constantly
looking to improve themselves and their skills. I'm really interested in working there
 through their intern program at UTSA. Some usefull skills there were reccomended for us
to learn was Python, Openstack, and some form of server automation languages.
