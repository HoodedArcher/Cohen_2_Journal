Basically some sick-o was trafficking kitty exploitation material onto the
network and using some of our encryption software to hide it. The material was
discovered on a device sold from the company so naturally they traced its
origin to m57 patents. After aquiring permits for seizure we took the an 
employee named Jo's computer and flash drive and found encrypted kitty 
exploitation material on his devices. Thanks to the invesitigation of Jo's 
computer and flash drive we were able to compile enough evidence convict Jo 
for possession of kitty exploitation material.
