No I don't really spend hours with linux and networking at home but I guess
I really should if I'm serious about possibly working there.
When it comes to something I am familiar with I am pretty good at problem
solving but at rackspace they seemed to have a large theme about asking
others for help when trying to learn or understand new things.
I have not finished my disk image but I am close I just need to put
something in my disk. I was trying to finish my many partitions work first.
