To generalize atleast to my understanding is applying information you already
know to something that is similar to the thing you're recalling the
information from.

Five questions I would ask on the test would be over how to grep, how to mount
something with an offset, how to recover a file from slackspace, how to create
a disk and partition it, and lastly how to find deleted files.

I believe all these questions should be covered in our test since they made up
a large portions of our projects this year and is something we covered
regularly enough to remember but not regularly enough to know completely by
heart.
