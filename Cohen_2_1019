A disk image is an exact copy of a disk.
You use DD to clone disks.
A disk partition is a segment of a disk that is divided/reserved.
You may partition a disk as much as you have space to do so.
Each segment is usually used to store specific files to reduce clutter.
You must organize your segments efficiently and reasonably to have a well working disk.
