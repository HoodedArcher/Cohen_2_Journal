Google got in trouble for scanning network traffic with kismet.
The software they used was kismet.
They "mistakenly" recorded network traffic.
I believe google did not make an honest mistake they should know the
software well enough to know that kismet by default monitors and
records network traffic. The files had even been opened by google and
possibly decrypted somewhere else.
