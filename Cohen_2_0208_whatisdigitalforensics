1.I thought digital forensic investigators had machines where they could clone all the information from a suspect's computer and analyze it on a binary scale if need be.
2.When I signed up for digital forensics I figured I would be investigating hackers and how people manipulate software/hardware to do illegal things like keylogging, packet sniffing, etc.
3.Investigations are well documented, never tamper with original files, and are as in depth as the investigator desires.
4.They probably think we rip apart the computers and inspect them based on physical and digital properties.
5.Yes, I have been accepted into UTSA and plan on majoring in CS.
6.Go to UTSA, be my room mate.
